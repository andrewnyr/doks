**Get Started**

Go to the "members" tab of the settings page. ([https://dash.statusflare.com/settings/members/](https://dash.statusflare.com/settings/members/ "https://dash.statusflare.com/settings/members/"))

Enter an email (of another Statusflare user) in the box and press the "+ Add User" with either "Read" or "Read and Write" to give that user access to your account.

If a user has access to more than one account they can select their profile picture and a dropdown will show with the name of the other account(s) that the user has access to.
