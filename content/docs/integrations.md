In addition to hosting status pages, Statusflare can send a message in a Discord or Slack channel to inform you that a monitor is down. Social integrations are very easy to add with the whole process taking less than a minute.

In the top right of the screen, press the orange "+ Add Integration" button. Next select which type of integration you would like to configure with Statusflare. Currently, only Discord and Slack are supported.

***

## Discord

After you select "Discord" and press configure, you will be taken to a discord login screen. Once logged in, you will be asked what server you would like to attach to Statusflare.

**Note: Please note that you can only add Statusflare to discord servers that you own.**

Once authorized, you will be taken back to the Integrations page of Statusflare where you will now see your integration with a button labeled "test." You can use the button to ensure that the connection between Statusflare and your server is complete.

That's it, you are officially done!

## Slack

After you select "Slack" and press configure, you will be taken to a slack login screen. Once logged in, you will be asked what workspace you would like to attach to Statusflare.
